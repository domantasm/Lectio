JAVAFX Application
- Database System, sqlite3 (used to store all the needed information of the tutor, student, position, timeslot etc)
- Google Maps Api (used to find the distance between the student and the tutor, allowing to show the results sorted by distance) 

The problem we are trying to solve is the process of finding the ideal tutor. By providing a
platform for private tutors to showcase their skills and expertise, individuals are able to find a
tutor that matches their needs and expectations with ease.

The application is JavaFx protype with high level UX design and all the basics functionality included.
Developed by three students, in Queen Mary University, as a Software Engineering Project.
